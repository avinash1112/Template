FINAL TOUCH UP
- add prometheus
- Add a prerequisite for the server configurations - maybe a separate README.md file on how homeserver was configured
- use README file to try to deploy (as if a student was trying it)
- create a README file

- make bash .infra/.scripts better in terms of UI: mirror laravel project start and artisan commands

- create CI/CD pipeline with tests, github workflows, github actions, etc..

- test full deployment with another company name with subdomain, look for any mywirelessworld trace and fix (in case hardcoded values)
- test full deployment with another company name without subdomain, look for any mywirelessworld trace and fix (in case hardcoded values)
- test full deployment without subdomain (mywirelessworld.ca instead of staff.mywirelessworld.ca)

- review .gitignore & .dockerignore files
- make sure ./.build/.env-build and ./.build/.env-build-example matches



K8S
- review ./scripts: prod env variables parsing for 01-render-files & 03-deploy-staging/prod
- review sentinel behaviour in prod and deploy a cronjob for promotion if needed

- set up a cronjob sort of thing that check if a restore was performed on master, then trigger a re-config on replicas automatically
- set up cronjob for mysql restore (should handle alongside mysql promoter etc... review full docker setup as there are a lot of case scenarios)
- set up cronjob for mysql backup
- review mysql promoter cronjob

- review scripts to apply manifests conditionally based on backend and frontend choices
- remove any missed env var when running 01-render-files
- check for any hardcoded values in .templates/k8s/* => create dynamic vars where it makes sense

- review sequence of deploying (like in docker-compose we have depends_on healthy in k8s should be something like marked as COMPLETED at least 1/1 - not just RUNNING state)
- nodejs pod's life is independent of other pods since frontend & backend are decoupled
- review pods states so that if their dependant dies and no available re-spawns, they die too (waterfall effect on dependencies)
- review probes for all deployments/statefulsets

- add nodejs deployment/statefulset
- review nginx deployment (see if should be changed to statefulset because of replicas)
- add php-workers deployment/statefulset
- review php-app deployment (see if should be changed to statefulset because of replicas)
- add redis statefulset (because of replica - follow same pattern as mysql)
- review mysql statefulset

- review docker volume mounts and create secrets/configMap/PVC as needed
- shared volume only needed for dev (follow docker-compose override. For prod, the files are baked into the image)

- add ttlSecondsAfterFinished to all pods 
- remove unnecessary meta data in manifests
- review all files and remove unnecessary config that are now set in the docker images



FIXES
- review scripts to apply dockerfiles, templates rendering, ssl certs, etc.. conditionally based on backend choice
- introduce tests for nodejs backend

- once config finalized, move both php backend & nodejs backend to a folder under .templates and based on user choice that folder gets copied into /backend
- do a full backend for nodejs (replacing the php app and php workers containers)
- add option for backend to use either php or nodejs (still decoupled frontend)

- review scripts to apply dockerfiles, templates rendering, ssl certs, etc.. conditionally based on frontend choice
- once config finalized, move both Vue & React to a folder under .templates and based on user choice that folder gets copied into /frontend
- develop UI in React
- add option for frontend to use either Vue or React

- introduce tests for services in a dedicated view
  - send a write to mysql master to create table, insert, update, delete data & fails create a new db
  - read user create, insert, update, delete should fail
  - read user select should pass
  - something for redis write
  - something for redis read
  - something for php-app
  - something for php-workers
  - something for nginx
  - something for nodejs frontend

- make better UI: mirror test_app

  box shadow: 0 0 0 0px #fff, 0 0 0 1px rgb(31 41 55 / 1), 0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 8px 10px -6px rgb(0 0 0 / .1)

- review UID and GID changes in dockerfiles (currently commented out)
- review healthchecks timers so app can start faster
- update docker-compose file with proxy depends on nginx replica count & nodejs replica count
- update docker-compose file with nginx depends on php-workers replica count
- update docker-compose file with php-workers depends on php-app replica count
- update docker-compose file with php-app depends on mysql replica count & redis replica count

- update script through env files to apply pvcs and pvs yml based on selected storage source
- configure laravel local storage with longhorn in prod
- configure laravel to use local storage or cloudflare r2 conditionally (apply config/filesystems.php code appropriately based on choice of storage)
- add a dynamic configuration for S3 (cloudflare R2)

- test redis write and read pods using view
- scaffold a Laravel helper class or middleware for redis read write behavior.
- test mysql write and read pods
- scaffold a Laravel helper class or middleware for safe mysql read-after-write behavior.
- update view with an email sending test
- move php workers tasks to workers pods

- move test_app to frontend test nodejs (UI sort of thing to view all pods and run some test on master/slave, load balancing, etc...)
- test cors, etc (no auth since this is a blank project, should be as broad as possible so can be used as a template)
- make some api calls from frontend and test functionality
- configure CORS in laravel for frontend
- make laravel full api mode
- remove all frontend stuffs from laravel

- update readiness checks for nginx to wait for custom initialization to finish, then run checks and only then is considered ready
- review liveness and readiness for nginx
- add replicas for nginx
- use includes for nginx.conf
- review nginx setup to follow best practice and any enhancements

- update readiness checks for php-workers to wait for custom initialization to finish, then run checks and only then is considered ready
- update readiness checks for php-app to wait for custom initialization to finish, then run checks and only then is considered ready
- add replicas for php-workers
- add replicas for php-app
- add php workers container will all entrypoint/init logic and artisan queue:work command
- review php setup to follow best practice and any enhancements

- update readiness checks for redis to wait for custom initialization to finish, then run checks and only then is considered ready
- review liveness & readiness for redis
- update docker-compose file with php-app depends on redis replica count
- add replicas for redis (possibly using sentinel for better coordination)
- get rid of Reading from client: error:00000000:lib(0)::reason(0)
- make sure redis is using TLS over TCP instead of socket
- review redis setup to follow best practice and any enhancements

- review backup/restore logic and adjust if needed
- review initialization logic so if a master dies and a replica is promoted if the current setup will work
- review replica coordination if will work in prod. Adjust if needed - don't rely on ordinals
- review mysql setup to follow best practice and any enhancements

- update docker-compose file with proxy depends on nodejs replica count
- update nodejs liveness & readiness checks for nodejs to wait for custom initialization to finish, then run checks and only then is considered ready
- update nodejs entrypoint
- add replicas for nodejs

- remove chmod/chown of certs in dockerfile and add in entrypoint instead
- review best practice for mounting even server certs so its not backed in the image
